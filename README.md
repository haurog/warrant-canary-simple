# warrant-canary-simple
Simplified warrant canary contract in Solidity and Cairo to compare the smart contract languages.

The basis for the solidity contract is from the [full warrant canary contract](https://github.com/haurog/blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project) implemented as the final project for the consensys bootcamp. The functionality to  enclose funds is removed as a simplification. THis simplified version is then reimplemented in the [Cairo smart contract programming language](https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/). 


# How to Deploy

These contracts are meant to be used via an online editor like [Remix](http://remix.ethereum.org/) for the solidity contract and [Starknet Playground](https://starknet.io/playground/i) for the Cairo contract.

Copy the content of these contracts into the respective online editor and compile/deploy.
