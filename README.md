# warrant-canary-simple
Simplified warrant canary contract in Solidity and Cairo to compare the smart contract languages.

The basis for the solidity contract is from the [full warrant canary contract](https://github.com/haurog/blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project) implemented as the final project for the consensys bootcamp. The functionality to  enclose funds is removed as a simplification. THis simplified version is then reimplemented in the [Cairo smart contract programming language](https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/).
